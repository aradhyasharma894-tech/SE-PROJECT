# AI-Powered Diagnosis Classifier for Pneumonia and COVID-19

## 📌 Introduction
This project aims to build an AI-powered classifier that can automatically detect Pneumonia and COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Using deep learning and medical imaging, the model will assist in early diagnosis and improve decision-making for clinicians.

## 🎯 Goals
- Preprocess chest X-ray images into a format suitable for AI models.
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Classify cases into **Normal**, **Pneumonia**, or **COVID-19**.
- Provide reproducible steps and clear documentation.
